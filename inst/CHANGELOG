# RcmdrPlugin.BYUMPA Changelog

## 0.5 -- June 7, 2012

* Added: The dialog for ordinal logistic regression now uses the `ordinal` library instead of the `MASS` library, since `ordinal` reports p-values in the summary table for the model.
* Added: The "Factor change coefficients" function in the Models menu calculates `e^b` for coefficients in logistic models.
* Fixed: Models created with `ordinal`'s `clm()` function now register in R Commander's model list, allowing users to use functions in the Models menu on objects of class `sclm`
* Removed: Ordinal logistic regression menus based on the `MASS` library.


## 0.1-0.2.1 -- May 2012

* Various alpha releases
